# Matrix: Calculator and Equations Solver
This is my project dedicated to the basic topic of linear algebra - operations on matrices and matrix equations. This is my attempt to automate many operations on matrices studied at university. My Python implementation covers topics such as:
1. Loops and conditional operators;
2. List Comprehension;
3. OOP (__init__, @classmethod, operator overloading);
4. Working with modules;
