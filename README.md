# LinAlg: Matrix Calculator and Equations Solver.

This is my project dedicated to the basic topic of linear algebra - operations on matrices and matrix equations. This is my attempt to automate many operations on matrices studied at university. My Python implementation covers topics such as:
1. Loops and conditional operators;
2. List Comprehension;
3. OOP (`__init__`, `@staticmethod`, `@property`, operator overloading, inheritance);
4. Working with modules;

What you can do in `matrix.py`?
1. Find transposed,inversed, cofactor matrices;
2. Find the sum of matrices;
3. Multiply matrix by number or by another matrix, or by itself;

What you can do in `equations.py`?
1. Solve matrix equations of two types;
