# Matrix: Calculator and Equations Solver

This is my project dedicated to the basic topic of linear algebra - operations on matrices and matrix equations. This is my attempt to automate many operations on matrices studied at university. My Python implementation covers topics such as:
1. Loops and conditional operators;
2. List Comprehension;
3. OOP ('__init__', '@classmethod', operator overloading, inheritance);
4. Working with modules;

What you can do in _matrix.py_?
1. Find transponed, inversed, cofactor matrices;
2. Add matrices;
3. Multiply matrix by number or by another matrix, or by itself;

What you can do in _equations.py_?
1. Solve matrix equations of two types;

What you can do in _coordinate.py_?
1. Create the coordinates in matrix and change their position;
